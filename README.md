# BinaryConverter

## Description

### Motivation

I want to create my own number converter from a number system to another number system.

### Why did I build this project?

I like Java, and I am Java junior developer, and to understand this language better. I build this little and absolutely useless project.

### Solving problems

1. Conversion from one number system to another one

# What is ready???

1. Conversion from binary number system to decimal for integers.

## TODO
* Conversion from binary number system to decimal for fractional and integer numbers.
* Allow the user to select a number system converting to.
* Complement logic of converting to decimal number system. User should pick the number system his own.

## Done
* Ask user about desirable number type (fractional/integer)
* Sure, console input
* Divided logic
* Error handling
