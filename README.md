# Binary Converter (in development)
## Description
### Motivation

I wanted to write a program that converts binary numbers to decimal

### Why did I build this project?

Since I recently started learning Java, I need to make some interesting projects

### Solving problems

1. Conversion binary to decimal

### Features

1. Has validation (not yet)
2. Since it is a service, there is no any try/catch block inside, that block for client
